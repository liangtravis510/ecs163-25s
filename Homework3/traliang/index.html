        <h1>Exploring Pokémon Stats</h1>
        <p>
            For the two interaction techniques I've chosen to implement, I've gone ahead and went with selection and brushing
        </p>
        <h5>Stacked Bar Chart</h5>
        <p>
            For the stacked bar chart, I've gone ahead and implemented a way such that when you click on the legend, it will show all the available type_1 types of all the generations
            in the dataset. In addition I've added a reset button to reset the dataset for the user. The stacked bar chart helps to show the distribution of types across all the generation and the 
            interaction through selection helps focus the users on specific types for all the generations.
        </p>
        <h5>Radar Bar Chart</h5>
        <p>
            For the radar chart, I've implemented a way for the user to select two different pokemon of their choosing using a drop down menu to choose two pokemon and compare their
            individual stats. For differentiating the two, I've chosen to use their type_1 types and if they shared the same type_1 types, I've gone ahead and altered the hue. 
            The goal of this chart now is to let users fiddle around with 
            searching different pokmeon and comparing the individual stat totals and see how different they are in certain aspects such as HP or even speed      
            
        </p>
         <h5>Parallel Coordinate Plot</h5>
        <p>
            For the advanced visualization, I've previously added a highlight feature on search as well as show its name on mouse hover. 
            I've gone ahead and added an addition aspect in the
            search where now when moused over the highlighted region that it will show the sprite as well as a detailed information card about the pokemon. 
            In addition, without search you can hover over certain lines to see stats of different pokemon.
            The goal of this chart was to give the user a more detailed view of a specific pokemon and how it stacks up individually and gives the exact stat totals on hover
