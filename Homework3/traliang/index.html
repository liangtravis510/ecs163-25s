        <h1>Pokémon Dashboard</h1>
        <p>
            For the two interaction techniques I've chosen to implement, I've gone ahead and went with selection and brushing
        </p>
        <h5>Stacked Bar Chart</h5>
        <p>
            For the stacked bar chart, I've gone ahead and implemented a way such that when you click on the legend, it will show all the availiable type_1 types of all the generations
            in the dataset
        </p>
        <h5>Radar Bar Chart</h5>
        <p>
            For the radar chart, I've implemented a way for the user to select two different pokemon of their choosing using a drop down menu to choose two pokemon and compare their
            individual stats. For differencianting the two, I've choosen to use their type_1 types and if they shared the same type_1 types I've gone ahead and altered the hue.            
            
        </p>
         <h5>Parallel Coordinate Plot</h5>
        <p>
            For the advanced visualization, I've previously added a highlight feature on search as well as show its name of mouse hover. I've gone ahead and added an addition aspect in the
            search where now when moused over the highlighted region that it will show the sprite as well as its type_1 and type_2 typings.
