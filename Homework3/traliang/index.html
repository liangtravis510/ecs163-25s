        <h1>Exploring Pokémon Stats</h1>
        <p>
            This dashboard is designed to help users explore how stats in pokemon have evolved over generations and then go into detail on specific pokemon
        </p>
        </p>
        <h5>Bar Chart</h5>
        <p>
            To give a general overview for the user,  the goal of the bar chart was to show the total stat distributions by generation via a bar chart and see the changes over time. To add some of the requirements for HW3, I've gone ahead 
            and added some transitions between bar charts as well as fit them color themes of the different generations based on the video game title (ie. red, gold, emerald, diamond, black, X & Y 
            (I've gone with purple here))
        </p>
        <h5>Radar Bar Chart</h5>
        <p>
            Once the user has seen the stat distrbutions I figured that the user would then want to see a radar chart to get some insight on specific pokmeon and comparing the two. For this I've gone ahead and 
            added a drop down menu and animations to show the change in the user's selection and visually give them an idea of the different stat totals.  
            
        </p>
         <h5>Parallel Coordinate Plot</h5>
        <p>
            This advance visualization was to now focus the user on a specific pokemon either through a filtering out their types or by search the pokemon outright. Here users can hover over the line to see
            their exact pokemon visually using gifs from Pokemon Showdown website as well as their stats and their type1 or type2 typings. If they choose not to search, they can still hover to see pokeon in the chart
